const ETD_description = '"Enter The Dragons” takes a frank,  funny and fearless look at the subject of female aging, examining the concerns and societal pressures that surround women as they pass fifty. The show reclaims the archetypal Hero’s Journey and reframes it from the perspective of the mature woman. Banished from the land of the young, and beset by challenges, riddles and obstacles, our Protagonist must navigate this weird landscape, guided by mystical creatures and Seers who have gone before. What wisdom can they impart? How can she best equip herself to defeat the demons? Expect stupid characters, ridiculous costumes, puppetry, buffoonery and many, many wigs.Written and performed by Abigail Dooley and Emma Edwards. Direction by Toby Park and Will Kerley. '
